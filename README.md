## 3. ETL Process (SSIS)
![ETL overview](docs/images/Data-mapping-diagram.png)
*Figure 5 – Overall ETL control flow for Manufacturing data mart*
The ETL layer is implemented with **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**.

### 3.1. Dimension ETL
![ETL Dim_Product](docs/images/ETL_Dim_Product.png)
*Figure 6 – Sample SSIS Data Flow for Dim_Product (Merge Join + SCD)*
Common steps:

1. **Extract** from source tables using **OLE DB Source**.
2. **Sort** by business key (e.g., ProductID, LocationID).
3. Use **Data Conversion** where types differ (e.g., Availability to float).
4. Apply **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)** to track changes over time.
5. **Load** into Dim tables using OLE DB Destination.

Specific notes:

- **Dim_Location**
  - Source: `Production.Location`
  - Convert `Availability` to float.
  - SCD to capture changes in cost rate / availability.

- **Dim_Product**
  - Sources: `Production.ProductCategory`, `Production.ProductSubcategory`, `Production.Product`
  - Use **Merge Join** to combine Category–Subcategory–Product hierarchy.
  - SCD handles changes in product attributes (price, category, etc.).

- **Dim_ScrapReason**
  - Source: `Production.ScrapReason`
  - Simple SCD, mainly type-1 changes.

- **Dim_Date**
  - Generated using a T-SQL calendar script (no direct source table).
  - Loaded via SSIS into Dim_Date.

### 3.2. Fact ETL – Fact_Manufacturing
![ETL Fact_Manufacturing](docs/images/ETL-Fact-Manufacturing.png)
*Figure 7 – SSIS Data Flow for Fact_Manufacturing (Lookup + Conditional Split)*
Two strategies:

1. **Full Load**
   - Used initially.
   - `Truncate` Fact_Manufacturing.
   - Load all joined data from `WorkOrder` + `WorkOrderRouting` into the fact table.

2. **Incremental Load**
   - Used for regular updates.
   - Use **Lookup** to check if a row already exists in Fact_Manufacturing.
   - Handle nulls in LocationID or ScrapReasonID with **Conditional Split**.
   - Use **OLE DB Command** to update existing rows or insert new ones.

This design supports both historical tracking and efficient daily loading.

## 4. KPIs & Data Analysis

### 4.1. Key KPIs

1. **Fiscal YTD – Production**
   - `TotalProduction = SUM(StockedQty)` per fiscal year.
   - Measures total quantity produced.

2. **Completion Rate**
   - `CompletionRate = StockedQty / OrderQty`
   - Measures production efficiency and ability to fulfill orders.

3. **Fiscal YTD – Resource Hours**
   - `ResourceHours = SUM(ActualResourceHrs)` per year.
   - Shows total labor / machine hours used.

4. **Fiscal YTD – Waste**
   - `WasteCost = SUM(ScrappedQty * StandardCost)`
   - Monetary value of scrapped products.

5. **Waste Percent**
   - `WastePercent = (Total ScrappedQty / Total OrderQty) * 100`

6. **Average Production Lead Time**
   - `LeadTime = AVG(ActualEndDate - ActualStartDate)` by product / subcategory.

7. **Cost Variance**
   - `CostVariance = ActualCost - PlannedCost`
   - Positive → over budget; negative → under budget.

8. **On-time Production Rate**
   - `OnTimeRate = % of work orders where ActualEndDate <= ScheduledEndDate`.

## 5. Main Findings (Summary of analysis)

### 5.1. Production volume & trend

- Total yearly production (all products):
  - **2011:** 6,045 units  
  - **2012:** 15,459 units  
  - **2013:** 27,652 units (peak)  
  - **2014:** 17,975 units (drop vs. 2013, still higher than 2011–2012)  
- Interpretation:
  - Strong growth up to 2013 (expansion, higher demand, or better efficiency).
  - Drop in 2014 suggests demand changes, capacity issues, or strategic shift.

### 5.2. Inventory & locations

- **Subassembly**: 95,477 units (≈29% of inventory)
- **Miscellaneous Storage**: 83,173 units (≈25%)
- **Tool Crib**: 72,899 units (≈22%)

These three locations hold **>75%** of total inventory, and Subassembly is the most critical buffer.  

### 5.3. Production & delay by location

- Subassembly has:
  - Highest production quantity
  - Highest production days
  - Highest overdue days
- Overdue days are strongly correlated with high production days, especially mid-month, indicating **capacity or scheduling bottlenecks** in busy periods.

### 5.4. Finished goods & sales

- Finished Goods Storage holds **17,319** units, with 152 products ready for sale.
- Top ready-for-sale items (324 units each):  
  `Half-Finger Gloves`, `Mountain Pump`, `Road Bottle Cage`, `Short-Sleeve Classic Jersey`, `Sport-100 Helmet`, `Women’s Tights`.

- Sales:
  - **274,914 orders** for **266 products**
  - Total revenue ≈ **$109.8M**
  - Best-selling product: **Mountain-200 Black, 38** – **2,977 orders**, **$4.4M** revenue.

### 5.5. Quality & scrap

- Scrap is concentrated in a **small set of reasons and locations** (Top-5 reasons, Top-5 locations).
- These hotspots drive most of the **Waste Cost** KPI, making them priority targets for improvement.

### 5.6. Lead time & performance

- Some product subcategories have **longer average lead times** and **lower on-time delivery rate**.
- Overdue production is again strongest in **Subassembly** and specific high-volume subcategories.
- Cost variance is positive in several operations → actual cost > planned cost, indicating inefficiencies or poor estimation.

## 8. Business Recommendations

### 8.1. Short-term actions

1. **Focus on top scrap reasons & locations**
   - Deep-dive into the Top-5 scrap reasons and Top-5 locations driving waste.
   - Introduce additional **quality checks** at these stations.
   - Update work instructions / quick re-training for operators on failure modes.

2. **Stabilize Subassembly**
   - Adjust shift planning and overtime for Subassembly during mid-month peaks.
   - Re-balance load to other locations where possible.
   - Prioritize **critical orders** to improve On-time Production rate.

3. **Tighten planning for high-value products**
   - Products like **Mountain-200 Black** bring high revenue; ensure better capacity planning and stricter quality control.
   - Monitor KPIs (lead time, scrap, cost variance) specifically for top-revenue SKUs.

4. **Improve estimation of planned cost**
   - For operations with large **positive cost variance**, review standard cost assumptions.
   - Quickly update routing standards and labor times to reflect reality.

5. **Introduce weekly KPI review**
   - Simple routine: every week the Production Manager checks:
     - Completion Rate
     - Waste Percent
     - On-time Production Rate
   - Use dashboard to identify anomalies early.

### 8.2. Long-term actions

1. **Capacity & layout redesign for Subassembly**
   - Use historical data (resource hours, lead time, overdue days) to simulate different layouts.
   - Consider **additional machines** or re-organizing the line to remove bottlenecks.

2. **Predictive maintenance**
   - Combine machine downtime logs with ActualResourceHrs to build a **predictive maintenance** model.
   - Goal: reduce unplanned downtime, especially during high-load mid-month.

3. **Standardization & continuous improvement program**
   - Use scrap & delay data to run structured **root cause analysis (5 Why, Fishbone)**.
   - Establish continuous improvement projects (Kaizen) on:
     - Scrap reduction
     - Setup time reduction
     - Standardized work at critical locations.

4. **Advanced demand & capacity planning**
   - Integrate sales forecasts with production planning to smooth the mid-month peaks.
   - Align inventory policies (safety stock at Subassembly) with actual variability.

5. **BI as an ongoing capability**
   - Expand this manufacturing data mart to include **Purchasing**, **Inventory**, and **Sales** for end-to-end visibility.
   - Promote self-service BI so line managers can track their own KPIs.
